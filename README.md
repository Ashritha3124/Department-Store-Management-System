# Department Store Management System (DSMS) in C

## 📌 Overview

This is a **Department Store Management System** implemented in **C language**.
It allows basic operations such as:

* Add new items
* Display all items
* Search for a specific item
* Update item details
* Delete items

Data is stored in a text file (`item.txt`) for persistence.

## ⚡ Features

* Console-based user interface
* File handling for data storage
* Menu-driven program
* Simple and beginner-friendly C implementation


## 🖥️ Requirements

* **Windows OS** (tested on Turbo C++, Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)
* A C compiler (GCC, Turbo C, or MSVC)
* `conio.h` header support (for `getch()`)

> ⚠️ Note: The code uses `system("cls")`, `system("Color")`, and `conio.h`, which are Windows-specific.
> For Linux/Mac, you may need to remove/replace these functions.
